% 'port' is the tcp/ip port for commanding create
%
% This file initializes tcp/ip port for use with iRobot Create
% remoteHost is the ip address of the beagleboard
% ex. CreateBeagleInit('192.168.1.141') sets ip = '192.168.1.141'
% copy this file along with PacketType.m into MatlabToolBoxiRobotCreate
%
% The tcp/ip server must be running on the Raspberry Pi before running this
% code.
%
% If you receive the error "Unsuccessful open: Connection refused: connect"
% ensure that the server code is running properly on the Raspberry Pi
%
% An optional time delay can be added after all commands
% if your code crashes frequently.  15 ms is recommended by iRobot
